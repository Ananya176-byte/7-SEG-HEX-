# 7-SEG-HEX-
PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project implements a 7-segment HEX decoder using basic logic gates. The decoder takes a 4-bit binary input (0000 to 1111) and generates the corresponding control signals to drive a 7-segment display, displaying hexadecimal digits (0-9, A,b,C,d,E,F). The design is implemented and simulated in NI Multisim.

FEATURES:

✅ Converts 4-bit binary input to hexadecimal (0-9, A-F) on a 7-segment display

✅ Implemented using only basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR)
